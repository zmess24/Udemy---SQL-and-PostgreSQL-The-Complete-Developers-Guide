# Aggregation of Records

### Grouping vs Aggregation

**Grouping**
* Reduces many rows down to fewer rows.
* Done by using the 'GROUP BY' Keyword.
* Visualizing the result is the key to use.

**Aggreation**
* Reduces many values down to one.
* Done by using 'aggregate functions'.

**Aggregate Functions**
* MIN: Finds minimum value from a group of numbers
* MAX: Finds maximum value from a group of numbers;
* SUM: Finds sum of a group of numbers
* AVG: Finds average of a group of numbers
* Count: Returns the number of values in a group of values (null values not counted).
